Hi, I am @JonDoucette, an Information Management Major who graduated in December 2020. I am proficient in Python and am working towards proficiency in R and other data modeling software. 
I currently hold a CompTIA A+ Certification.

I hope to pursue a career in data analytics or technical support because I enjoy solving problems and getting to the root cause. 
I've been building computers since I was young and the passion for technology has only increased from there. 
Each day I look forward to learning even more about data science and tech support in the technology industry!

If you are interested in talking about information management, programs, or data analytics, don't hesitate to contact me at jonrdoucette@gmail.com
