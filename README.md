<h1 align="center">Hello! ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jon Doucette</h1>
<h3 align="center">A motivated Senior Technical Support/Solutions Architect driven with passion for the tech industry!</h3>

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and mastering **Object-oriented Programming, General Data Analytics and Reporting Tools, and JS**

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **jonrdoucette@gmail.com**

I hope to pursue a career in data analytics, technical support, or software development because I enjoy solving problems and getting to the root cause. I've been building computers since I was young and the passion for technology has only increased from there. Each day I look forward to learning even more about data science, programming, and tech support in the technology industry! All of my Github repositories and projects were created as a result of my desire to learn and the skills/programming languages that I was able to teach myself. I look forward to growing my skills in general programming to continue making useful programs and software!
